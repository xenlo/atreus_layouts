## Intro ##
I'm trying to define a good bépo layout for my new KeyboardIO Atreus. As I'm moving it from one comptuter to another. I wanted to store the key layout somewhere. And on the git here, it can be shared to anyone interested.

### BÉPO mine ###
The `bépo_mine` directory contains my attempt to get a great bépo layout

### BÉPO LaurentB ###
`bépo_laurentb` is actually a porposition of bépo layout from [laurentb](https://forum.bepo.fr/profile.php?id=551) on [Atreus wiki page](http://bepo.fr/wiki/Atreus) of bepo.fr.

### QWERTY default ###
This `querty_default` is the default layout from factory.
